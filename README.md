## Abstract
Super Market Order Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the hypothesis that if you purchase a specific group of items, you are probably going to purchase another group of items. For example, if you are in an Irish pub and you buy a pint of beer and for some reason you decide not to buy a bar meal, you are more likely to buy chips simultaneously than someone who didn't buy a dip. In this analysis, a forecasting model is developed using machine learning algorithms to improve the accurate forecasts of product sales.

*The aim of this project is to predict the products the customer is most likely to buy in their next order based on the products which have been purchased previously.*
